Made a neural network using mathematics only using numpy that recognises hand written digits

- Imported MNIST dataset through sklearn.datasets

- Used matplotlib to show images and to plot graphs

- Calculated cost using Mean Squared Error

- Model showed ~91% accuracy on test sets

- Also tried the model to recognize custom hand-written digits
